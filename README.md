# rosalind_increasing_subsequence
Finds a longest increasing and decreasing subseqeunce for a randomly ordered permutation of up to 10000.

This code is a solution to the Rosalind problem Longest Increasing Subsequence (id = LGIS).

It takes input from a text file with a number (n) up to 10000 on the first line, and a randomly ordered permutation of n on the second line.
it returns a longest increasing subsequence and longest decreasing subsequence of the permuation.
